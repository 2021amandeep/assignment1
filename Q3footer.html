<h2>Make In INDIA</h2>
<p>Make in India is an initiative by the Government of India to encourage companies to manufacture in India and incentivize dedicated investments into manufacturing.[1] The policy approach was to create a conducive environment for investments, develop a modern and efficient infrastructure, and open up new sectors for foreign capital. The initiative targeted 25 economic sectors for job creation and skill enhancement,[2] and aimed "to transform India into a global design and manufacturing hub."[3]

"Make in India" had three stated objectives:

to increase the manufacturing sector's growth rate to 12-14% per annum;
to create 100 million additional manufacturing jobs in the economy by 2022;
to ensure that the manufacturing sector's contribution to GDP is increased to 25% by 2022 (later revised to 2025).[4]
After the launch, India gave investment commitments worth ₹16.40 lakh crore (US$230 billion) and investment inquiries worth of ₹1.5 lakh crore (US$21 billion) between September 2014 to February 2016.[5][6][7] As a result, India emerged as the top destination globally in 2015 for foreign direct investment (FDI), surpassing the United States and China, with US$60.1 billion FDI.[8] As per the current policy, 100% Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is permitted in all 100 sectors, except for Space industry (74%), defence industry (49%) and Media of India (26%).[9][10] Japan and India had also announced a US$12 billion 'Japan-India Make-in-India Special Finance Facility" fund to push investment.[11]

In line with the Make in India, individual states too launched their own local initiatives, such as 'Make in Odisha,' 'Tamil Nadu Global Investors Meet,' 'Vibrant Gujarat,' 'Happening Haryana' and 'Magnetic Maharashtra.'[12] India received US$60 billion FDI in FY 2016–17.[13]

The World Bank's 2019 Ease of Doing Business report acknowledges India's jump of 23 positions against its rank of 100 in 2017 to be placed now at 63rd rank among 190 countries.[14] By the end of 2017, India had risen 42 places on Ease of doing business index, 32 places World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Index, and 19 notches in the Logistics Performance Index,[13] thanks to recent governmental initiatives, which include converges, synergies and enables other important Government of India schemes, such as Bharatmala, Sagarmala, Dedicated Freight Corridors, Industrial corridors, UDAN-RCS, Bharat Broadband Network, Digital India.

Make in India has not yet achieved its goals. The growth rate of manufacturing averaged 6.9% per annum between 2014-15 and 2019-20.[15] The share of manufacturing dropped from 16.3% of GDP in 2014-15 to 15.1% in 2019-20.[15]

The "Make In India" initiative
Ease of Doing Business
India jumped to 63rd place out of 190 countries in the world Banks' 2019 Ease of Doing Business Index from 130th in 2016.[16] In February 2017, the government appointed the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the National Productivity Council "to sensitise actual users and get their feedback on various reform measures."[17] As a result, now there is competition among the states of India to improve their current ranking on the ease of doing business index based on the completion percentage scores on 98-point action plan for business reform under Make in India initiative.[18][19][20][21][22][23] Currently Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Haryana, Odisha, Chhattisgarh and West Bengal (44.35%) are top six states (c. Feb 2018).[24]

Ongoing global campaign
The campaign was designed by Wieden+Kennedy,[25] with the launch of a web portal and release of brochures on the 25 sectors, after foreign equity caps, norms and procedures in various sectors were relaxed, including application of manufacturing application made available online and the validity of licenses was increased to three years.[26]

"Zero Defect Zero Effect" slogan was coined by Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, as essence of the Make in India initiative that manages advanced processes, materials and technologies, to guide the production mechanism that produces products with no defects with no adverse environmental and ecological effects.[27][28]
